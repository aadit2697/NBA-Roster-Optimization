# Rubric for Project Proposal

Your project proposal will follow the format of a standard research proposal, and will be written in markdown format.  It should not be longer than 2-3 pages max, and may be shorter.  It will have the following sections.

### Title

A nice short title for your project, helping me to understand roughly what it is you are trying to do.

### Team

Each project will have a team of 3-5 people, an one person will serve as the point of contact for the team who will "own" the repository.  Everyone will be granted access to this repository.  This section should include the full names of each team member, **along with their github ids**, and indicate the point of contact for the group.

### Introduction

This section will introduce your project.  It will _briefly_ answer the following questions from Heilmeier's catechism.

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
