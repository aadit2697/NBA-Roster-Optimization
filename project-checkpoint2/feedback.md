- Does your proposal include all of the above mentioned sections? [10 points]

Roughly, yes. However, in the future it would be better if I only had to look at a single file unless otherwise instructed. 9/10

- Are your objectives concrete and do you have a clear stakeholder need? [10 points]

Yes, although I am concerned that your data here only covers two teams - it seems hard to generalize from just two teams and I don't recall you saying that this was all you would focus on?  8/10

Do you have a good data source and have you done a thorough job investigating its provenance and credibility? [5 points]

5/5

Did you do a thorough job exploring your data [10 points]

Ok, could have used more information about distributions, correlations.  Seems like this is work to be done?

8/10

Have you done some initial modeling of your problem and do you have some early baseline results? [10 points]

I would have liked to see some initial modeling to get a sense of how this is working 

8/ 10

Do you have a clear path forward [5 points]

Mostly - uncertain about the comments about "large numbers in the id column" - why aren't these being one-hot encoded?
